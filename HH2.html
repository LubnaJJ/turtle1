                Hikkaduwa is located in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka and is a coastal town in Galle. It has been a hotspot for tourist destinations in the country for several years, and one of the main reasons for this was because of the Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery. The Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery has been operating since 1996 and is a non-profit organization that aims to protect sea turtles from external threats and its extinction.

                They buy turtle eggs from poachers before they are sold for other purposes such as being killed alive, and their scales turned into ornaments for sale.

                Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery is a family-run organization hatchery that protects sea turtles such as the Olive ridley, leatherback turtle, green turtle, hawksbill turtle and loggerhead turtle and makes sure the hatchlings are sent into the ocean about 3-7 days after their hatching and if they’re healthy and strong enough to.

                The Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery plays an important role in raising awareness about the dangers and threats the sea turtles face.
