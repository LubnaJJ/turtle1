                            <p>Turtle hatcheries are facilities and places that nurture turtles, 
                            protect their hatchlings from predators and other threats whilst 
                            ensuring the turtle nests are preserved and protected.<br><br>
                            There are many species of turtles that are currently endangered or 
                            in threats of their hatchlings being sold by poachers and they are 
                            also open to other external threats. Therefore, turtle hatcheries 
                            ensure the safety of turtles and their hatchlings, and make sure
